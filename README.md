# 🚢 Online Cargo Tracking System for Riziki Flour Millers 🌾

## Project Overview

This project proposes the development of an Online Cargo Tracking System for Riziki Flour Millers in Mombasa County. The current manual system presents challenges such as low data retrieval, time wastage, and inefficient communication. The proposed system aims to provide timely and accurate ship arrival notifications to improve time management and cost-effectiveness.

## Objectives

1. **Efficient Cargo Tracking:** Replace the manual tracking system with an online platform that allows for real-time and efficient tracking of cargo. 🔄

2. **Timely Notifications:** Ensure timely and accurate notifications of ship arrivals to enhance planning and coordination. ⏰

3. **Cost-effectiveness:** Streamline processes to reduce time wastage and improve overall cost-effectiveness in cargo handling. 💰

## Methodology

### Rapid Application Development (RAD) 🚀

The project will adopt the RAD methodology to expedite the development process and ensure flexibility in responding to evolving requirements. RAD emphasizes iterative development and user feedback, allowing for continuous improvement throughout the project lifecycle.

### Data Collection

The Simple Random Sampling Technique will be employed for data collection. This method ensures a representative sample is gathered, contributing to the accuracy and reliability of the information collected for system development. 📊
